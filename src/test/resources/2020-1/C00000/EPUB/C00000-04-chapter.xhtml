      <span id="dtb128">My interest in Valentin Haüy, the father of education for the blind in Europe, was aroused while working at<abbr title="The Swedish Library of Talking Books and Braille" id="d910e709" epub:type="z3998:initialism" class="initialism">MTM</abbr>on a book about Louis Braille, the creator of the Braille system.</span>
      <span id="dtb129">I discovered that there was a dearth of literature on Haüy in Swedish, and that in the limited literature I was able to consult, information about him was often
                contradictory.</span>
      <span id="dtb130">In particular, I noticed that there were no references to the period of the more than ten years which Haüy spent in Russia.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span id="dtb131">In this paper I have proposed a number of research questions:</span>
    </p>
    <ul id="dtb132">
      <li id="d910e728">
        <span id="dtb133">Who was Valentin Haüy?</span>
        <span id="dtb134">What do we know about his life?</span>
      </li>
      <li id="d910e737">
        <span id="dtb135">What role did he play in the creation of special education for the blind?</span>
      </li>
      <li id="d910e743">
        <span id="dtb136">Was he really "the father of education for the blind" or were there others who merit that distinction?</span>
      </li>
      <li id="d910e749">
        <span id="dtb137">How great was his influence on the introduction of education for the blind in Sweden and other countries?</span>
      </li>
      <li id="d910e755">
        <span id="dtb138">What were his teaching methods?</span>
      </li>
      <li id="d910e762">
        <span id="dtb139">What happened during his stay in Russia - did he in fact found an institute for the blind in St Petersburg?</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
